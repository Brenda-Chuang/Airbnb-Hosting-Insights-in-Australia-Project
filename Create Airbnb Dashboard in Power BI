Creating Airbnb hosting dashboard in Power BI

Data Preparation – Fact_listings
   (1) Get data from the PostgreSQL database using DirectQuery.
   (2) Change the storage mode from DirectQuery to ‘import’ mode.
   (3) Change the table name to ‘Fact_listings.’
   (4) The id column seems corrupted. Extract the id from the ‘listing_url’ column using the delimiter ‘rooms/’ and rename the column as ‘listing_id’.
   (5) Change the data type to the correct format.
   (6) Unfiltered null data in the ‘first_review’ column. 

Data Preparation – Fact_reviews
   (1) Import data sources from reviews_WA, reviews_Brisbane, reviews_Melbourne, reviews_Sydney.
   (2) Append the above queries into a Fact_reviews table.
   (3) Merge the Fact_reviews table (many) with the Fact_listings table (one) and create a many-to-one relationship.
   (4) Remove the null values in the listing_id column of the Fact_reviews table. 
       (In the previous data cleaning process, multiple rows were removed so that some reviews could not link to the listings.)
   (5) Remove the comment column from the table 

Data Modelling
1.	Normalise the fact table and create the Dim_host table
  (1)	Duplicate the fact table. 
  (2)	Select host_id, host_name, and host_since and remove other columns. 
  (3)	Remove duplicates in the host_id column 
  (4)	Merge the fact table with Dim_host to create many-to-one relationships
2.	Normalise the fact table and create the Dim_location table
  (1)	Duplicate the fact table. 
  (2)	Select state and suburb and remove other columns. 
  (3)	Remove duplicates in both columns
  (4)	Add an index column and rename it as lication_id
  (5)	Merge the fact table with Dim_location to create many-to-one relationships
3.	Normalise the ‘property_type’ column
  (1)	Clean the data (resolve upper/lower case duplicate issue) and replace unnecessary characters in the fact table.
  (2)	Duplicate the fact table and change the table name to Dim_property_type.  
  (3)	Remove duplicates. Add an index column and rename it as propery_type_id
4.	Normalise the ‘room_type’ column
  (1)	Duplicate the fact table and change the table name to Dim_room_type.  
  (2)	Remove duplicates. Add an index column and rename it as room_type_id
5.	Hide all the foreign keys in the fact table to make them invisible in the report view.
6.	Create a Calendar table based on the review data
